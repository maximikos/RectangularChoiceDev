    "This notebook starts from an exemplary supply-use table (SUT) that features more commodities than industries (c>i). The cases of [c=i](./SU-RCOT_c=i.ipynb) and [c<i](./SU-RCOT_c-i+.ipynb) are illustrated in separate notebooks. All notebooks share the same basic structure. That is, an illustrative SUT is imported from a spreadsheet; solved for the cases of factor constraints being absent or present; and solved when new technologies are introduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the RCOT models allow for many degrees of freedom, certain aspects are highlighted only for either of the three SUT setups. For example, the issue of monetary or mixed commodity data is illustrated only in the [c=i](./SU-RCOT_c=i.ipynb) notebook. The overlapping parts, however, are explained in detail here and only briefly sketched out for the other two setups. Here, for the most part, we will look at the coefficient formulations of the RCOT models.\n",

    "With that, we see that a system consisting of more commodities than industries may have multiple alternate optimal solutions for its dual. That is, no unique solution for the price vector exists. The usefulness of the dual is hence limited in this case. The reason for this behaviour is, mathematically speaking, the row-wise linear dependence of the net output (coefficients) matrix; it is thus not of full rank. Economically, market actors would realise prices initially in such a way that products with the highest output receive the highest ones while others may be put on the market free of cost; in the present example, assuming that each industry is producing one primary product each next to potentially some secondary products, it is the primary products that receive non-zero prices. As seen above, however, other pricing strategies are possible, too, with an infinite combination of solution vectors being possible.\n",

    "## 5. New alternatives for single production\n",
    "In contrast to the two RCOT models in coefficient and absolute form above, the model by Duchin & Levine (2011) was formulated in coefficent form for single production. That is, by-products are reallocated. While this can be consistently done via any construct for the base SUT, it remains a challenge to keep this consistency when adding new technologies. To illustrate the challenge of adding new technologies based on observed supply-use information, we start from the underlying SUT, apply a construct of choice, try to reallocate the by-products of the alternative technologies (and adjust all other system variables accordingly), and then solve the IO-RCOT model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is easier said than done because the reallocation of by-products can be tricky for new technologies producing multiple commodities. Moreover, the data for the additional technologies must be converted from absolute to coefficient form."

    "- the primary output of both the dominant and new alternative technology is given in the same unit\n",
    "- AND the new technology produces only a single output\n",
    "- AND no additional data is given to allow for a more sophisticated conversion,\n",
    "\n",
    "the most straightforward way of deriving single production coefficients for such an alternative is to divide the respective matrices by the total output. This strategy is equivalent to the idea behind the lump-sum construct."
